# Checkers 
https://checkers-tamir.netlify.app/
The white player starts- click on one of them and if it can move it will show you where you can move, once you clicked where you want to move it will move there.
if you can eat the opposite player checker you have to 
you can eat to checkers in a row
in the first eating only forward if you do multiple eating in the same turn you can eat also backwards 
if you get to the other side of the board you get a queen which can move without limitation if available and can also eat backwards
Have fun!
